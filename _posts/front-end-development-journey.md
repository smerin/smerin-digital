Welcome to my front-end development blog! My name is George Smerin, and I'm a web and app developer based in Bristol, UK with over fifteen years of professional experience. Throughout my career, I've worked with a variety of front-end technologies, including many of the most popular frameworks and libraries.

Today, I want to share my expertise and insights with you through this blog. I'll be discussing best practices and techniques that apply across the board, as well as sharing examples of my work across a variety of technologies.

That being said, my current favourite framework for building user interfaces is React. It's used by some of the world's biggest companies, including Facebook, Instagram, and Airbnb. What I love about React is that it enables me to create dynamic, interactive web applications that are fast, responsive, and scalable.

But more than just using the right tools, I believe in creating experiences that captivate and delight users. That's why I focus on not only the technical capabilities of the tools I use, but also their potential to enhance the user experience. With my particular flair for design, animation, and user experience, I aim to create animations, transitions, and effects that captivate users and make them want to stay on a site longer.

In future posts, I'll be sharing examples of these techniques, as well as discussing new ideas and trends in front-end development. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, I hope you'll find something of value here.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to sharing my journey with you!
